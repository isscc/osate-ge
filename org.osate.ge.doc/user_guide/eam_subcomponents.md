## Subcomponents
The graphical editor allows editing subcomponents when viewing a component implementation diagram.



### Creating
When viewing a component implementation diagram, a subcomponent can be creating by using the palette. Drag the appropriate subcomponent type from the palette to the desired location. A new subcomponent will appear.



### Setting the Classifier
Select the subcomponent classifier by right-clicking on the subcomponent and selecting *Set Classifier...* from the context menu. After selecting the classifier, the subcomponent will be updated to show the appropriate features.
