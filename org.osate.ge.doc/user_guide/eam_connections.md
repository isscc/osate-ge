2. Select an appropriate feature as the start of the connection.

3. Select an appropriate feature as the end of the connection.  The new connection will appear.



### Editing Connections

#### Using the Context Menu to Edit Connections
Right click on a connection and all appropriate editing options will appear on the context menu.
