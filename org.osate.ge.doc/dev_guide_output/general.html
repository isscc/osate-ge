<h1 id="general-information">General Information</h1>
<p>Extensions to the graphical editor are registered as Eclipse extensions. Each extension is implemented by the Java Extensions are implemented which have a no-argument constructor and which contains annotations to specify which methods should be called. Required services and other arguments are passed into annotated methods via dependency injection.</p>
<p>The graphical editor is built on top of the Graphiti framework. In many cases knowledge of Graphiti is not required, but it is needed for more advanced use cases.</p>
<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>The graphical editor provides a limited set of services to extensions via dependency injection. The services are designed to provide a stable interface to capabilities which are needed when implementing extensions. Services provided for use by extensions are defined in the <emphasis>TBD</emphasis> package.</p>
<p><strong>Unless otherwise noted, extensions may be reused between diagrams. Extensions should not retain references to services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The set of services which will be provided to extensions has not yet been finalized.</strong></p>
<h2 id="annotations">Annotations</h2>
<p>Extensions are found in the <emphasis>org.osate.ge.ext.annotations</emphasis> package. The applicable extensions depend on the type of extension being implemented. For details regarding each annotation, it is recommended to consult the annotation package.</p>
